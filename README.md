# SoC-Data-Driven-Astronomy

Week 1:<br/>
Completed Assignment (i), (ii) and (iii) given by mentor.<br />
Assignment(i)-Plotted a histogram of probability distribution when two dice are thrown simultaneously using matplotlib.<br /> 
Assignment(ii)-Highlighted possible problems that may be encountered while performing data analysis.<br />
Assignment(iii)-Given a file containing a list of strings, the code sorts the strings in ascending order of their length, using bubble sort.

Week 2 and 3:<br/>
❖ Completed all graded exercises, assignments and videos from the first 4 weeks of the
course “Data-driven Astronomy”.<br/>
❖ Working on ungraded exercises from the first 2 weeks, involving median stacking,
cross-matching using k-d trees. Completed week 3 ungraded exercise involving SQL
joins and subqueries. Completed week 4 ungraded exercise involving a mix of Python
and SQL to perform calculations on exoplanet data from week 3.<br/>

Week 4:<br/>
❖ Completed all graded exercises, assignments and videos from week 5 and 6 of the
course.<br/>
❖ Completed ungraded exercise from week 5, involving k-fold validation.<br/>

Post completion of the course data driven astronomy:<br/>

Week 1:<br/>
❖ Started the course “The Evolving Universe”. Completed all videos, quizzes and
assignments from weeks 1 and 2.<br/>

Week 2:<br/>
❖ Completed all videos, quizzes and assignments from week 3. <br/>

Week 3:<br/>
❖ Completed all videos, quizzes and assignments from week 4.<br/>

Week 4:<br/>
❖ Completed all videos, quizzes and assignments from week 5. <br/>

Week 7 (post endsem):<br/>
❖ Completed all videos, quizzes and assignments from week 6 and 7.<br/>
❖ Completed watching Lectures 1 to 3 from PH556 course on basics of astrophysics.<br/>
❖ Started reading the paper on use of machine learning in astronomy and learnt about
types of ML, input data set classification (training, validation and testing), model
parameters and hyperparameters, evaluation metrics: ROC, MAE, MSE and confusion
matrix.<br/>

Week 8:<br/>
❖ Completed all videos, quizzes and assignments from week 8. <br/>
❖ Completed watching Lectures 3 to 6 from PH556. <br/>
❖ Continuing the paper: Learnt about supervised learning models and their use in
regression and classification: Support Vector Machine, decision trees and random
forests, probabilistic random forest ANNs. Started on unsupervised learning: uses and
distance assignment (failure of euclidean metric in some cases).<br/>

Week 9 (Final Week):<br/>
❖ Completed all videos, quizzes and assignments from weeks 9 and 10.<br/>
❖ Completed watching lecture 7 of PH556.<br/>
❖ Completed the ML paper; learnt more about unsupervised ML algorithms which are
mainly used in astronomy for clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering, dendrograms),
dimensionality reduction algorithms (principle component analysis, stochastic
embedding, autoencoders, self organising maps) and anomaly detectors.<br/>
